/* Write a function, howOld(), that has two number parameters, age and year, and returns how old someone who is currently that age was (or will be) during that year. Handle three different cases:

If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format:
'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'

If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:
'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'

If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:
'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]' */

const howOld = (age, year) => {
    // The following two lines make it so that our function always knows the current year.
        let dateToday = new Date();
        let thisYear = dateToday.getFullYear();
